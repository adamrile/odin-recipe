<ul>
  <li>2 olive oil, plus a little for the dish</li>
  <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
  <li>tomato sauce</li>
  <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
  <li>300g pack fresh lasagne sheets</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g
    lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the
    meat mixture.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot
    beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30
    x 20cm).
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white
    sauce, making sure you can’t see any pasta poking through.
