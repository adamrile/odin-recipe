<h3>Broccoli Pasta Shells are delicious</h3>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 head of broccoli, chopped into florets</li>
  <li>1 garlic clove, unpeeled</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>250g pasta shells</li>
  <li>½ small pack parsley</li>
  <li>½ small pack basil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Toss the broccoli and garlic in 1 tbsp
    of the olive oil on a roasting tray and roast in the oven for 10-12 mins,
    until softened.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tip the pasta shells into a pan of boiling, salted water. Cook according to
    packet instructions and drain. Tip the parsley, basil, pine nuts, lemon
    juice and parmesan into a blender. Once the broccoli is done, set aside a
    few of the smaller pieces. Squeeze the garlic from its skin, add to the
    blender along with the rest of the broccoli, pulse to a pesto and season
    well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Toss the pasta with the pesto. Add the reserved broccoli florets, split
    between two bowls and top with a little extra parmesan, the lemon zest and a
    good grinding of black pepper, if you like.
  </li>
</ol>
